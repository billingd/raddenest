RADDENEST

This package denests different classes of expressions with nested
roots. Most of the algorithms are specific to square roots, but some
handle higher roots.

The implemented algorithms are documented in the following articles:

As such, the raddenest function should be able to denest some or all
of the denestable expressions of the following types:

* square roots of sums of (multiple) unnested square roots
    (_sqrtdenest_rec)

* expressions of the form sqrt(a + b*sqrt(r)) that denest using square
    roots can be denested numerically or symbolically
    (_sqrt_symbolic_denest)

* expressions of the form sqrt(a + b*sqrt(r)) where a, b, and r are
    linear combinations of square roots of positive rationals
    (_sqrt_biquadratic_denest)

* expressions of the form sqrt(a + b*sqrt(r)) that can be denested
    using fourth roots

* n-th roots of a+b*sqrt(r)
    (_rad_denest_cardano)

* square roots of a sum of two cube roots
    (_rad_denest_ramanujan)


INTERPRETATION OF RADICAL EXPRESSIONS

In general a^(1/n) has n different values.

However Maxima always simplifies such numeric expressions for positive
real 'a' and for negative real 'a' in case of a square root:
    sqrt(-4)=2*%i, 8^(1/3)=2
This is independent of the global 'domain' variable.

With domain=complex Maxima no longer simplifies a^(1/n) for negative
real 'a'. It will only factor out (-1)^(1/n) which is then treated
according to the global variable m1pbranch. It also no longer simplifies
sqrt(x^2).

Raddenest should give results that are consistent with the above.

Example:
    (2-sqrt(5))^(1/3) = 1/2-sqrt(5)/2
This denesting is only performed when domain=real and the cube root
is interpreted as a real-valued function over the reals.


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

Functions whose names begin with an underscore are internal helper
functions. As such the only user-level function is the main command
"raddenest".

raddenest and _raddenest0 are relatively simple wrapper functions that
apply the various algorithm functions to the given expression and its
subexpressions.
